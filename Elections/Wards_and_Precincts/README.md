## Description
<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"><DIV><DIV><P STYLE="margin:0 0 0 0;"><SPAN>This polygon layer contains 11 wards and 33 precincts within the City of Cambridge. These were adjusted in 2021 from the 2020 U.S. Census.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>The Massachusetts Legislative boundaries do not follow these Cambridge Ward and Precinct boundaries in several areas. In part, this was because of the compressed timeline due to the Covid-19 pandemic during the 2020 US Census. Municipalities and the State were unable to coordinate precincts and legislative districts, and as a result sub-precincts within 9 precincts were unavoidable. Voters in a sub-precinct are listed on a separate voting list and have different ballots from other voters in the precinct during State </SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Elections.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Please see the ELECTIONS_WardsSubPrecincts layer for the divided precincts.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

## Purpose
