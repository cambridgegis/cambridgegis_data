      <abstract>The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which "... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards," Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The FIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The FIRM Database serves to archive the information collected during the Flood Risk Project.</abstract>
      <purpose>Polygon showing the 100 year, or 1% flood zone in Cambridge. A one-hundred-year flood is a flood event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

FIRM and FIS Effective Date July 8, 2025.</purpose>

        <attrlabl>zone_subty</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>Flood Zone Subtype. This field captures additional information about the flood zones. For example, Zone X could have “AREA WITH REDUCED FLOOD HAZARD DUE TO ACCREDITED LEVEE SYSTEM” or “0.2-PCT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD HAZARD” as a subtype. Types of floodways are also stored in this field. Floodways are designated by FEMA and adopted by communities to provide an area that will remain free of development to moderate increases in flood heights due to encroachment on the floodplain. Normal floodways are specified as ‘FLOODWAY.’ Special cases will have a more specific term for the designation (such as COLORADO RIVER) and will appear as a note on the hardcopy FIRM. See the FIRM Panel Technical Reference for available floodway notes. NOTE: The symbol ‘%’ is a reserved symbol in most software packages, so the word ‘percent’ was abbreviated to ‘PCT.’ Acceptable values for this field are listed in the D_Zone_Subtype table.</attrdef>
