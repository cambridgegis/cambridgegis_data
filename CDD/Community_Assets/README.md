## Description
<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"><DIV><DIV><P STYLE="margin:0 0 0 0;"><SPAN>This point layer shows a selection of community gathering places and service centers. Included locations focus on non-profit organizations with dedicated facilities that have a broad public recognition. The types of locations in this layer include arts and culture centers, community centers, health care facilities, community resources, and employment programs. Municipal and academic facilities other than performance facilities are not included. City-owned buildings are accounted for in other data layers. </SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

## Purpose
This layer was created by CDD staff in recognition of the fact that non-profit organizations provide real benefits to their neighborhoods.  It is anticipated that this layer will be added to neighborhood-scale maps to let residents know what kind of resources are available to them, and to inform City staff of the breadth of community assets present in each neighborhood.
