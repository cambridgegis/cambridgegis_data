## Description
<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>The City of Cambridge owns and maintains most street lights in the City. These were purchased from NSTAR in 2005. Some street lights are owned by other organizations. DCR, the State, and Universities all own lights along the roadways they maintain. These are the locations of those lights. The Cambridge owned street lights are in the GIS layer INFRA_StreetLights. The origin of the lights are from an April 14, 2010 flyover. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN><SPAN>City of Cambridge, MA GIS basemap development project encompasses the land area of City of Cambridge with a 200 foot fringe surrounding the area and Charles River shoreline towards Boston. The basemap data was developed at 1" = 40' mapping scale using digital photogrammetric techniques. Planimetric features; both man-made and natural features like vegetation, rivers have been depicted. These features are important to all GIS/mapping applications and publication. A set of data layers such as Buildings, Roads, Rivers, Utility structures, 1 ft interval contours are developed and represented in the geodatabase. The features are labeled and coded in order to represent specific feature class for thematic representation and topology between the features is maintained for an accurate representation at the 1:40 mapping scale for both publication and analysis. The basemap data has been developed using procedures designed to produce data to the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) and is intended for use at 1" = 40 ' mapping scale.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>THIS ONLY REFLECTS LIGHTS CAPTURED BY THE 2010 FLYOVER AND WAS NOT FIELD VERIFIED</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
