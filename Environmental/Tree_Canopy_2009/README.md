## Description
<DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>The tree canopy is the layer of leaves, stems, and branches of trees that cover the ground when viewed from above. An analysis of Cambridge's tree canopy based on land cover data derived from a November 2009 LiDAR capture and high resolution aerial imagery taken in 2010, found that 1,222 acres representing 30% of all land in the City were covered by tree canopy. Cambridge's urban tree canopy is a vital city asset that reduces storm water run-off, improves air quality, reduces the city's carbon footprint, enhances quality of life, contributes to savings on energy bills, mitigates heat effects, and serves as habitat for wildlife. The Spatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of the Environment and Natural Resources carried out the assessment in collaboration with the City of Cambridge Community Development Department and the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
